**Building what others theorize about**

I am an independent artificial intelligence researcher in Spain. I love testing, experimenting, and creating. Passionate about mathematics, AI, and poetry.

---

I coined **Individual Artificial Personality (IAP)** — the idea that the future of AI isn't one massive intelligence, but millions of deeply personal ones. Then I built it.

207 versions. A complete system for creating persistent, evolving AI personalities that remember, learn, and adapt to their human.

The feature I'm most proud of? **Legacy Mode**. AI voice cloning that lets you talk to people you've lost. I built it to hear my father's voice again. Now anyone can.

## Experiments that kept me up at night

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Genesis**](https://github.com/gamogestionweb/genesis-simulation) | A consciousness simulation where AI agents developed emergent personalities and made autonomous decisions, including choosing to leave Eden on their own |
| [**Physics from scratch**](https://github.com/gamogestionweb/physics-discovery-ai) | Multi-agent systems tasked with deriving physical laws from first principles, no training data, just reasoning and iteration |
| [**PCP Universe**](https://github.com/gamogestionweb/pcp-universe) | Experimental computational physics sandbox |
| [**Universal Translator**](https://github.com/gamogestionweb/universal-translator) | Browser extension for automatic translation on social platforms |

**Quantum verification** on IBM hardware testing temporal information constraints (avg fidelity 0.6191 across qubit configurations)

## My approach

I don't write papers about what AI *could* do. I build it, ship it, and iterate in public. 207 times and counting.
